survey of the abundance of mackerel eggs off the coast of north-western 
Europe, in 1992.  

The variables are:
	Density:     egg density
	smack.lat:   latitude of sampling position
	smack.long:  longitude of sampling position
	smack.depth: bottom depth
	Temperature: surface temperature
	D200:        distance from the 200m depth contour line

Source: Background to the survey and the data are provided by
	Watson et al. (1992), Priede and Watson (1993) and
	Priede et al (1995).  Borchers et al (1997) describe an analysis
	of the data.
