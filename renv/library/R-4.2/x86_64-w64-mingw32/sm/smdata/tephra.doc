			Tephra data
			
These data record the percentages of aluminium oxide found in samples
from a tephra layer resulting from a volcanic eruption in Iceland
around 3500 years ago.

The variables are:
	Al2O3: percentage of aluminium oxide
	
Source: The data were collected by A.Dugmore.  The geological background 
	to the data is given by Dugmore et al (1992), Geochemical 
	stability of finegrained silicic tephra in Iceland and Scotland, 
	J.Quatern.Sci. 7, 173-83.
