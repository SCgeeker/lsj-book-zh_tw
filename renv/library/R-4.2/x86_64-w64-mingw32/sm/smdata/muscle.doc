			Muscle data
			
The data refer to the counts of fibres of different types in 
groups of fibres taken from rat skeletal muscles.  

The variables are:
	row.labels: an indicator of the 'fascicle', or group of fibres
	TypeI.R:    number of Type I (reticulated) fibres
	TypeI.P:    number of Type I (punctate) fibres
	TypeI.B:    number of Type I fibres of both types
	TypeII:     number of Type II fibres
