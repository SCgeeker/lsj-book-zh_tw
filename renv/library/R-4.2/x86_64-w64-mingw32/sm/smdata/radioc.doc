			Radiocarbon data
			
These data record high precision measurements of radiocarbon on
Irish oak, used to construct a calibration curve.

The variables are:
	Rc.age:    age predicted from the radiocarbon dating process
	Precision: a measure of precision of the dating process
	Cal.age:   true calendar age
