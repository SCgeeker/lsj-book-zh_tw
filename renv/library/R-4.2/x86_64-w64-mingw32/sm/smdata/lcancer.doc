			Laryngeal cancer data
			
These data record the spatial positions of cases of laryngeal cancer
in the North-West of England between 1974 and 1983, together with the
positions of a number of lung cancer patients who were used as controls.
The data have been adjusted to preserve anonymity.

The variables are:
	Easting:  a west-east grid reference
	Northing: a north-south grid reference
	Cancer:   an indicator of laryngeal (1) or lung (2) cancer
