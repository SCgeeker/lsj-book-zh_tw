			Dogs data

Measurements of coronary sinus potassium (mil equivalent per litre)
were made at (1,3,5,7,9,11,13) minutes after coronary occlusion in a 
number of different dogs.  There are four treatment groups 
(group 1 is the control).  The paper by Grizzle and Allen provides a 
full description of the treatments.  A few subjects develop ventricular 
fibrillation (see paper for details).

The variables are:
	Group:                        a treatment group indicator
	P1, P3, P5, P7, P9, P11, P13: measurements at indicated times
