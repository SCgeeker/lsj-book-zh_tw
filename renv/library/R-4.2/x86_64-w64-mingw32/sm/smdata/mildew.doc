			Mildew data
			
The data refer to study of mildew control sponsored by Bainbridge,
Jenkyn and Dyke at Rothamsted Experimental Station.  There were four
treatments, one of which was a control.  There were 36 adjacent plots,
with an extra plot at each end.  Nine blocks were created by grouping
the plots in fours.

The variables are:
	t1, t2, t3:  indicators of the four treatment groups
	p1, ..., p8: indicators of the nine blocks
	Yield:       tons of grain per hectare
