			Trout data
			
These data were collected in a toxocological experiment conducted
at the University of Waterloo.  Different concentrations of
potassium cyanate were applied to vials of trout eggs.  The eggs
in half of the vials were allowed to water-harden before the
toxicant was applied.

The variables are:
	Concentr: toxicant concentration
	Trouts:   number of trout eggs
	Dead:     number of eggs which died
	Insert:   an indicator of whether the eggs were allowed
		  	to water-harden

	and partial residual plots for the detection of influential
	observations in generalized linear models.

	The data are also reported by Hand et al. (1994), A Handbook
	of Small Data Sets, data set no.418.
