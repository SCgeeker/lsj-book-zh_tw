Description: Functions are provided for computing the density and the
  distribution function of d-dimensional normal and "t" random variables,
  possibly truncated (on one side or two sides),  and for generating random 
  vectors sampled from these distributions, except sampling from the truncated
  "t". Moments of arbitrary order of a multivariate truncated normal are
  computed, and converted to cumulants up to order 4. 
  Probabilities are computed via non-Monte Carlo methods; different routines 
  are used in the case d=1, d=2, d=3, d>3, if d denotes the dimensionality.
