* This file contains a short test program, software for MVN distribution 
* subroutines SADMVN, RANMVN, KROMVN and SPHMVN, plus supporting software.
* The file is self contained and should compile without errors on (77) 
* standard Fortran compilers. The test program demonstrates the use of
* four different methods for computing MVN distribution values for a
* five dimensional example problem, with three different integration limit
* combinations.
