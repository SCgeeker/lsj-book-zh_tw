<span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> On the psychology of statistics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#on-the-psychology-of-statistics"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>To the surprise of many students, statistics is a fairly significant
part of a psychological education. To the surprise of no-one, statistics
is very rarely the <em>favourite</em> part of one’s psychological education.
After all, if you really loved the idea of doing statistics, you’d
probably be enrolled in a statistics class right now, not a psychology
class. So, not surprisingly, there’s a pretty large proportion of the
student base that isn’t happy about the fact that psychology has so much
statistics in it. In view of this, I thought that the right place to
start might be to answer some of the more common questions that people
have about stats.</p>
<p>A big part of this issue at hand relates to the very idea of statistics.
What is it? What’s it there for? And why are scientists so bloody
obsessed with it? These are all good questions, when you think about it.
So let’s start with the last one. As a group, scientists seem to be
bizarrely fixated on running statistical tests on everything. In fact,
we use statistics so often that we sometimes forget to explain to people
why we do. It’s a kind of article of faith among scientists – and
especially social scientists – that your findings can’t be trusted until
you’ve done some stats. Undergraduate students might be forgiven for
thinking that we’re all completely mad, because no-one takes the time to
answer one very simple question:</p>
<p><em>Why do you do statistics? Why don’t scientists just use <u>common
sense?</u></em></p>
<p>It’s a naive question in some ways, but most good questions are. There’s
a lot of good answers to it,<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Including the suggestion that common sense is in short supply
among scientists.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> but for my money, the best
answer is a really simple one: we don’t trust ourselves enough. We worry
that we’re human, and susceptible to all of the biases, temptations and
frailties that humans suffer from. Much of statistics is basically a
safeguard. Using “common sense” to evaluate evidence means trusting gut
instincts, relying on verbal arguments and on using the raw power of
human reason to come up with the right answer. Most scientists don’t
think this approach is likely to work.</p>
<p>In fact, come to think of it, this sounds a lot like a psychological
question to me, and since I do work in a psychology department, it seems
like a good idea to dig a little deeper here. Is it really plausible to
think that this “common sense” approach is very trustworthy? Verbal
arguments have to be constructed in language, and all languages have
biases – some things are harder to say than others, and not necessarily
because they’re false (e.g., quantum electrodynamics is a good theory,
but hard to explain in words). The instincts of our “gut” aren’t
designed to solve scientific problems, they’re designed to handle day to
day inferences – and given that biological evolution is slower than
cultural change, we should say that they’re designed to solve the day to
day problems for a <em>different world</em> than the one we live in. Most
fundamentally, reasoning sensibly requires people to engage in
“induction”, making wise guesses and going beyond the immediate evidence
of the senses to make generalisations about the world. If you think that
you can do that without being influenced by various distractors, well, I
have a bridge in London I’d like to sell you. Heck, as the next section
shows, we can’t even solve “deductive” problems (ones where no guessing
is required) without being influenced by our pre-existing biases.</p>
<div id="the-curse-of-belief-bias" class="section level3" number="1.1.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> The curse of belief bias<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-curse-of-belief-bias"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>People are mostly pretty smart. We’re certainly smarter than the other
species that we share the planet with (though many people might
disagree). Our minds are quite amazing things, and we seem to be capable
of the most incredible feats of thought and reason. That doesn’t make us
perfect though. And among the many things that psychologists have shown
over the years is that we really do find it hard to be neutral, to
evaluate evidence impartially and without being swayed by pre-existing
biases. A good example of this is the <strong>belief bias effect</strong> in logical
reasoning: if you ask people to decide whether a particular argument is
logically valid (i.e., conclusion would be true if the premises were
true), we tend to be influenced by the believability of the conclusion,
even when we shouldn’t. For instance, here’s a valid argument where the
conclusion is believable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All cigarettes are expensive (Premise 1)<br>
Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2)<br>
Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here’s a valid argument where the conclusion is not believable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All addictive things are expensive (Premise 1)<br>
Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2)<br>
Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The logical <em>structure</em> of argument #2 is identical to the structure of
argument #1, and they’re both valid. However, in the second argument,
there are good reasons to think that premise 1 is incorrect, and as a
result it’s probably the case that the conclusion is also incorrect. But
that’s entirely irrelevant to the topic at hand; an argument is
deductively valid if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the
premises. That is, a valid argument doesn’t have to involve true
statements.</p>
<p>On the other hand, here’s an invalid argument that has a believable
conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All addictive things are expensive (Premise 1)<br>
Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2)<br>
Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, an invalid argument with an unbelievable conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All cigarettes are expensive (Premise 1)<br>
Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2)<br>
Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, suppose that people really are perfectly able to set aside their
pre-existing biases about what is true and what isn’t, and purely
evaluate an argument on its logical merits. We’d expect 100% of people
to say that the valid arguments are valid, and 0% of people to say that
the invalid arguments are valid. So if you ran an experiment looking at
this, you’d expect to see data as in Table <a href="why-do-we-learn-statistics.html#tab:tab1-1">1.1</a>.</p>

<p>If the psychological data looked like this (or even a good approximation
to this), we might feel safe in just trusting our gut instincts. That
is, it’d be perfectly okay just to let scientists evaluate data based on
their common sense, and not bother with all this murky statistics stuff.
However, you guys have taken psych classes, and by now you probably know
where this is going.</p>
<p>In a classic study, <span class="citation">J. St. B. T. Evans, Barston, and Pollard (<a href="references.html#ref-Evans1983" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>)</span> ran an experiment looking at exactly this. What they found is that when
pre-existing biases (i.e., beliefs) were in agreement with the structure
of the data, everything went the way you’d hope (Table <a href="why-do-we-learn-statistics.html#tab:tab1-2">1.2</a>).</p>

<p>Oh dear, that’s not as good. Apparently, when people are presented with
a strong argument that contradicts our pre-existing beliefs, we find it
pretty hard to even perceive it to be a strong argument (people only did
so 46% of the time). Even worse, when people are presented with a weak
argument that agrees with our pre-existing biases, almost no-one can see
that the argument is weak (people got that one wrong 92% of the
time!).<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;In my more cynical moments I feel like this fact alone explains
95% of what I read on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>If you think about it, it’s not as if these data are horribly damning.
Overall, people did do better than chance at compensating for their
prior biases, since about 60% of people’s judgements were correct (you’d
expect 50% by chance). Even so, if you were a professional “evaluator of
evidence”, and someone came along and offered you a magic tool that
improves your chances of making the right decision from 60% to (say)
95%, you’d probably jump at it, right? Of course you would. Thankfully,
we actually do have a tool that can do this. But it’s not magic, it’s
statistics. So that’s reason #1 why scientists love statistics. It’s
just too easy for us to “believe what we want to believe”. So instead,
if we want to “believe in the data”, we’re going to need a bit of help
to keep our personal biases under control. That’s what statistics does,
it helps keep us honest.</p>

California, Berkeley had some worries about the admissions of students
into their postgraduate courses. Specifically, the thing that caused the

that there were nearly 13,000 applicants, a difference of 9% in
admission rates between males and females is just way too big to be a
coincidence. Pretty compelling data, right? And if I were to say to you

<p>Remarkably, most departments had a <em>higher</em> rate of admissions for
females than for males! Yet the overall rate of admission across the
university for females was lower than for males. How can this be? How
can both of these statements be true at the same time?</p>
<p>Here’s what’s going on. Firstly, notice that the departments are not
equal to one another in terms of their admission percentages: some
departments (e.g., A, B) tended to admit a high percentage of the
qualified applicants, whereas others (e.g., F) tended to reject most of
the candidates, even if they were high quality. So, among the six
departments shown above, notice that department A is the most generous,
followed by B, C, D, E and F in that order. Next, notice that males and
females tended to apply to different departments. If we rank the
departments in terms of the total number of male applicants, we get
<strong>A</strong>&gt;<strong>B</strong>&gt;D&gt;C&gt;F&gt;E (the “easy” departments are in bold). On the
whole, males tended to apply to the departments that had high admission
rates. Now compare this to how the female applicants distributed
themselves. Ranking the departments in terms of the total number of
female applicants produces a quite different ordering
C&gt;E&gt;D&gt;F&gt;<strong>A</strong>&gt;<strong>B</strong>. In other words, what these data seem to be
suggesting is that the female applicants tended to apply to “harder”
departments. And in fact, if we look at Figure <a href="why-do-we-learn-statistics.html#fig:fig1-1">1.1</a> we see that this
trend is systematic, and quite striking. This effect is known as
<strong>Simpson’s paradox</strong>. It’s not common, but it does happen in real life,
and most people are very surprised by it when they first encounter it,
and many people refuse to even believe that it’s real. It is very real.
And while there are lots of very subtle statistical lessons buried in
there, I want to use it to make a much more important point: doing
research is hard, and there are lots of subtle, counter-intuitive traps
lying in wait for the unwary. That’s reason #2 why scientists love
statistics, and why we teach research methods. Because science is hard,
and the truth is sometimes cunningly hidden in the nooks and crannies of
complicated data.</p>
<p>Before leaving this topic entirely, I want to point out something else
really critical that is often overlooked in a research methods class.
Statistics only solves <em>part</em> of the problem. Remember that we started
all this with the concern that Berkeley’s admissions processes might be
unfairly biased against female applicants. When we looked at the
“aggregated” data, it did seem like the university was discriminating
against women, but when we “disaggregate” and looked at the individual
behaviour of all the departments, it turned out that the actual
departments were, if anything, slightly biased in favour of women. The
gender bias in total admissions was caused by the fact that women tended
to self-select for harder departments. From a legal perspective, that
would probably put the university in the clear. Postgraduate admissions
are determined at the level of the individual department, and there are
good reasons to do that. At the level of individual departments the
decisions are more or less unbiased (the weak bias in favour of females
at that level is small, and not consistent across departments). Since
the university can’t dictate which departments people choose to apply
to, and the decision making takes place at the level of the department
it can hardly be held accountable for any biases that those choices
produce.</p>

<p>That was the basis for my somewhat glib remarks earlier, but that’s not
exactly the whole story, is it? After all, if we’re interested in this
from a more sociological and psychological perspective, we might want to
ask <em>why</em> there are such strong gender differences in applications. Why
do males tend to apply to engineering more often than females, and why
is this reversed for the English department? And why is it the case that
the departments that tend to have a female-application bias tend to have
lower overall admission rates than those departments that have a
male-application bias? Might this not still reflect a gender bias, even
though every single department is itself unbiased? It might. Suppose,
hypothetically, that males preferred to apply to “hard sciences” and
females prefer “humanities”. And suppose further that the reason for why
the humanities departments have low admission rates is because the
government doesn’t want to fund the humanities (Ph.D. places, for
instance, are often tied to government funded research projects). Does
that constitute a gender bias? Or just an unenlightened view of the
value of the humanities? What if someone at a high level in the
government cut the humanities funds because they felt that the
humanities are “useless chick stuff”. That seems pretty blatantly gender
biased. None of this falls within the purview of statistics, but it
matters to the research project. If you’re interested in the overall
structural effects of subtle gender biases, then you probably want to
look at both the aggregated and disaggregated data. If you’re interested
in the decision making process at Berkeley itself then you’re probably
only interested in the disaggregated data.That was the basis for my

<p>In short there are a lot of critical questions that you can’t answer
with statistics, but the answers to those questions will have a huge
impact on how you analyse and interpret data. And this is the reason why
you should always think of statistics as a tool to help you learn about
your data. No more and no less. It’s a powerful tool to that end, but
there’s no substitute for careful thought.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Statistics in psychology<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#statistics-in-psychology"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I hope that the discussion above helped explain why science in general
is so focused on statistics. But I’m guessing that you have a lot more
questions about what role statistics plays in psychology, and
specifically why psychology classes always devote so many lectures to
stats. So here’s my attempt to answer a few of them…</p>
<p><strong>Why does psychology have so much statistics?</strong></p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, there’s a few different reasons, some of which
are better than others. The most important reason is that psychology is
a statistical science. What I mean by that is that the “things” that we
study are <em>people</em>. Real, complicated, gloriously messy, infuriatingly
perverse people. The “things” of physics include objects like electrons,
and while there are all sorts of complexities that arise in physics,
electrons don’t have minds of their own. They don’t have opinions, they
don’t differ from each other in weird and arbitrary ways, they don’t get
bored in the middle of an experiment, and they don’t get angry at the
experimenter and then deliberately try to sabotage the data set (not
that I’ve ever done that!). At a fundamental level psychology is harder
than physics.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Which might explain why physics is just a teensy bit further
advanced as a science than we are.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a> Basically, we teach statistics to you as
psychologists because you need to be better at stats than physicists.
There’s actually a saying used sometimes in physics, to the effect that
“if your experiment needs statistics, you should have done a better
experiment”. They have the luxury of being able to say that because
their objects of study are pathetically simple in comparison to the vast
mess that confronts social scientists. And it’s not just psychology.
Most social sciences are desperately reliant on statistics. Not because
we’re bad experimenters, but because we’ve picked a harder problem to
solve. We teach you stats because you really, really need it.</p>
<p><strong>Can’t someone else do the statistics?</strong></p>
<p>To some extent, but not completely. It’s true that you don’t need to
become a fully trained statistician just to do psychology, but you do
need to reach a certain level of statistical competence. In my view,
there’s three reasons that every psychological researcher ought to be
able to do basic statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, there’s the fundamental reason: statistics is deeply
intertwined with research design. If you want to be good at designing
psychological studies, you need to at the very least understand the
basics of stats.</li>
<li>Secondly, if you want to be good at the psychological side of the
research, then you need to be able to understand the psychological
literature, right? But almost every paper in the psychological
literature reports the results of statistical analyses. So if you really
want to understand the psychology, you need to be able to understand
what other people did with their data. And that means understanding a
certain amount of statistics.</li>
<li>Thirdly, there’s a big practical problem with being dependent on
other people to do all your statistics: statistical analysis is
<em>expensive</em>. If you ever get bored and want to look up how much the
Australian government charges for university fees, you’ll notice
something interesting: statistics is designated as a “national priority”
category, and so the fees are much, much lower than for any other area
of study. This is because there’s a massive shortage of statisticians
out there. So, from your perspective as a psychological researcher, the
laws of supply and demand aren’t exactly on your side here! As a result,
in almost any real life situation where you want to do psychological
research, the cruel facts will be that you don’t have enough money to
afford a statistician. So the economics of the situation mean that you
have to be pretty self-sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a lot of these reasons generalise beyond researchers. If you
want to be a practicing psychologist and stay on top of the field, it
helps to be able to read the scientific literature, which relies pretty
heavily on statistics.</p>
<p><strong>I don’t care about jobs, research, or clinical work. Do I need
statistics?</strong></p>
<p>Okay, now you’re just messing with me. Still, I think it should matter
to you too. Statistics should matter to you in the same way that
statistics should matter to <em>everyone</em>. We live in the 21st century, and
data are <em>everywhere</em>. Frankly, given the world in which we live these
days, a basic knowledge of statistics is pretty damn close to a survival
tool! Which is the topic of the next section.</p>

<p>When I started writing up my lecture notes I took the 20 most recent
news articles posted to the ABC news website. Of those 20 articles, it
turned out that 8 of them involved a discussion of something that I
would call a statistical topic and 6 of those made a mistake. The most
common error, if you’re curious, was failing to report baseline data
(e.g., the article mentions that 5% of people in situation X have some
characteristic Y, but doesn’t say how common the characteristic is for
everyone else!). The point I’m trying to make here isn’t that
journalists are bad at statistics (though they almost always are), it’s
that a basic knowledge of statistics is very helpful for trying to
figure out when someone else is either making a mistake or even lying to
you. In fact, one of the biggest things that a knowledge of statistics
does to you is cause you to get angry at the newspaper or the internet
on a far more frequent basis. You can find a good example of this in the
section <a href="descriptive-statistics.html#a-real-life-example">A real life example</a> in the chapter on <a href="descriptive-statistics.html#descriptive-statistics">Descriptive statistics</a>.
In later versions of this book I’ll try to include more anecdotes along
those lines.</p>

</h2>
<p>So far, most of what I’ve talked about is statistics, and so you’d be
forgiven for thinking that statistics is all I care about in life. To be
fair, you wouldn’t be far wrong, but research methodology is a broader
concept than statistics. So most research methods courses will cover a
lot of topics that relate much more to the pragmatics of research
design, and in particular the issues that you encounter when trying to
do research with humans. However, about 99% of student fears relate to
the statistics part of the course, so I’ve focused on the stats in this
discussion, and hopefully I’ve convinced you that statistics matters,
and more importantly, that it’s not to be feared. That being said, it’s
pretty typical for introductory research methods classes to be very
stats-heavy. This is not (usually) because the lecturers are evil
people. Quite the contrary, in fact. Introductory classes focus a lot on
the statistics because you almost always find yourself needing
statistics before you need the other research methods training. Why?
Because almost all of your assignments in other classes will rely on
statistical training, to a much greater extent than they rely on other
methodological tools. It’s not common for undergraduate assignments to
require you to design your own study from the ground up (in which case
you would need to know a lot about research design), but it <em>is</em> common
for assignments to ask you to analyse and interpret data that were
collected in a study that someone else designed (in which case you need
statistics). In that sense, from the perspective of allowing you to do
well in all your other classes, the statistics is more urgent.</p>
<p>But note that “urgent” is different from “important” – they both matter.
I really do want to stress that research design is just as important as
data analysis, and this book does spend a fair amount of time on it.
However, while statistics has a kind of universality, and provides a set
of core tools that are useful for most types of psychological research,
the research methods side isn’t quite so universal. There are some
general principles that everyone should think about, but a lot of
research design is very idiosyncratic, and is specific to the area of
research that you want to engage in. To the extent that it’s the details
that matter, those details don’t usually show up in an introductory
stats and research methods class.</p>
