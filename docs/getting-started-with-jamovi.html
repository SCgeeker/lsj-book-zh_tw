<p>In this chapter I’ll discuss how to get started in jamovi. I’ll briefly
talk about how to download and install jamovi, but most of the chapter
will be focused on getting you started with finding your way around the
jamovi GUI. Our goal in this chapter is not to learn any statistical
concepts: we’re just trying to learn the basics of how jamovi works and
get comfortable interacting with the system. To do this we’ll spend a
bit of time looking at datasets and variables. In doing so, you’ll get a
bit of a feel for what it’s like to work in jamovi.</p>
<p>However, before going into any of the specifics, it’s worth talking a
little about why you might want to use jamovi at all. Given that you’re
reading this you’ve probably got your own reasons. However, if those
reasons are “because that’s what my stats class uses”, it might be worth
explaining a little why your lecturer has chosen to use jamovi for the
class. Of course, I don’t really know why <em>other</em> people choose jamovi
so I’m really talking about why I use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s sort of obvious but worth saying anyway: doing your statistics
on a computer is faster, easier and more powerful than doing
statistics by hand. Computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks,
and a lot of statistical calculations are both mindless and
repetitive. For most people the only reason to ever do statistical
calculations with pencil and paper is for learning purposes. In my
class I do occasionally suggest doing some calculations that way,
but the only real value to it is pedagogical. It does help you to
get a “feel” for statistics to do some calculations yourself, so
it’s worth doing it once. But only once!</li>
<li>Doing statistics in a conventional spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft
Excel) is generally a bad idea in the long run. Although many people
likely feel more familiar with them, spreadsheets are very limited
in terms of what analyses they allow you do. If you get into the
habit of trying to do your real life data analysis using
spreadsheets then you’ve dug yourself into a very deep hole.</li>
<li>“student versions” (crippled versions of the real thing) very
cheaply, and then they they sell full powered “educational versions”
at a price that makes me wince. They will also sell commercial
licences with a staggeringly high price tag. The business model here
is to suck you in during your student days and then leave you
dependent on their tools when you go out into the real world. It’s
hard to blame them for trying, but personally I’m not in favour of
shelling out thousands of dollars if I can avoid it. And you can
avoid it. If you make use of packages like jamovi that are open
source and free you never get trapped having to pay exorbitant
licensing fees.</li>
<li>Something that you might not appreciate now, but will love later on
if you do anything involving data analysis, is the fact that jamovi
is basically a sophisticated front end for the free R statistical
programming language. When you download and install R you get all
the basic “packages” and those are very powerful on their own.
However, because R is so open and so widely used, it’s become
something of a standard tool in statistics and so lots of people
write their own packages that extend the system. And these are
freely available too. One of the consequences of this, I’ve noticed,
is that if you look at recent advanced data analysis textbooks then
a lot of them use R.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the main reasons I use jamovi. It’s not without its flaws,
though. It’s relatively new<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;As of the first writing this in August 2018. Later versions of this book
will use later versions of jamovi.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a> so there is not a huge set of
textbooks and other resources to support it, and it has a few annoying
quirks that we’re all pretty much stuck with, but on the whole I think
the strengths outweigh the weakness; more so than any other option I’ve
encountered so far.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Installing jamovi<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installing-jamovi"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Okay, enough with the sales pitch. Let’s get started. Just as with any
piece of software, jamovi needs to be installed on a “computer”, which
is a magical box that does cool things and delivers free ponies. Or
something along those lines; I may be confusing computers with the iPad
marketing campaigns. Anyway, jamovi is freely distributed online and you
can download it from the jamovi homepage, which is: <a href="https://www.jamovi.org/">https://www.jamovi.org/</a></p>
<p>At the top of the page, under the heading “Download”, you’ll see
separate links for Windows users, Mac users, and Linux users. If you
follow the relevant link you’ll see that the online instructions are
pretty self-explanatory. As of this writing, the current version of
jamovi is 0.9, but they usually issue updates every few months, so
you’ll probably have a newer version.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Although jamovi is updated frequently it doesn’t usually make much
of a difference for the sort of work we’ll do in this book. In fact,
during the writing of the book I upgraded several times and it didn’t
make much difference at all to what is in this book.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Starting up jamovi<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#starting-up-jamovi"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>One way or another, regardless of what operating system you’re using,
it’s time to open jamovi and get started. When first starting jamovi you
will be presented with a user interface which looks something like Figure <a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#fig:fig3-1">3.1</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>To the left is the spreadsheet view, and to the right is where the
results of statistical tests appear. Down the middle is a bar separating
these two regions and this can be dragged to the left or the right to
change their sizes.</p>
<p>It is possible to simply begin typing values into the jamovi spreadsheet
as you would in any other spreadsheet software. Alternatively, existing
data sets in the CSV (.csv) file format can be opened in jamovi.
Additionally, you can easily import SPSS, SAS, Stata and JASP files
directly into jamovi. To open a file select the File tab (three
horizontal lines signify this tab) at the top left hand corner, select
‘Open’ and then choose from the files listed on ’Browse’ depending on
whether you want to open an example or a file stored on your computer.</p>

<div id="analyses" class="section level2" number="3.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Analyses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#analyses"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Analyses can be selected from the analysis ribbon or menu along the top.
Selecting an analysis will present an ‘options panel’ for that
particular analysis, allowing you to assign different variables to
different parts of the analysis, and select different options. At the
same time, the results for the analysis will appear in the right
‘Results panel’ and will update in real-time as you make changes to the
options.</p>
<p>When you have the analysis set up correctly you can dismiss the analysis
options by clicking the arrow to the top right of the optional panel. If
you wish to return to these options, you can click on the results that
were produced. In this way, you can return to any analysis that you (or
say, a colleague) created earlier.</p>
<p>If you decide you no longer need a particular analysis, you can remove
it with the results context menu. Right-clicking on the analysis results
will bring up a menu and by selecting ‘Analysis’ and then ‘Remove’ the
analysis can be removed. But more on this later. First, let’s take a
more detailed look at the spreadsheet view.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-spreadsheet" class="section level2" number="3.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> The spreadsheet<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-spreadsheet"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In jamovi data is represented in a spreadsheet with each column
representing a ‘variable’ and each row representing a ‘case’ or
‘participant’.</p>
<div id="variables" class="section level3" number="3.3.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Variables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#variables"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The most commonly used variables in jamovi are ‘Data Variables’, these
variables simply contain data either loaded from a data file, or ‘typed
in’ by the user. Data variables can be one of several measurement
levels (Figure <a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#fig:fig3-2">3.2</a>).</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:fig3-2"></span>
<img src="images/Figure3.PNG" alt="measurement levels" width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 3.2: measurement levels
</p>
</div>
<p>These levels are designated by the symbol in the header of the
variable’s column. The ID variable type is unique to jamovi. It’s
intended for variables that contain identifiers that you would almost
never want to analyse. For example, a persons name, or a participant ID.
Specifying an ID variable type can improve performance when interacting
with very large data sets.</p>
<p><em>Nominal</em> variables are for categorical variables which are text labels,
for example a column called Gender with the values Male and Female would
be nominal. So would a person’s name. Nominal variable values can also
have a numeric value. These variables are used most often when importing
data which codes values with numbers rather than text. For example, a
column in a dataset may contain the values 1 for males, and 2 for
females. It is possible to add nice ‘human-readable’ labels to these
values with the variable editor (more on this later).</p>
<p><em>Ordinal</em> variables are like Nominal variables, except the values have a
specific order. An example is a Likert scale with 3 being ‘strongly
agree’ and -3 being ‘strongly disagree’.</p>
<p><em>Continuous</em> variables are variables which exist on a continuous scale.
Examples might be height or weight. This is also referred to as
‘Interval’ or ‘Ratio scale’.</p>
<p>In addition, you can also specify different data types: variables have a
data type of either ‘Text’, ‘Integer’ or ‘Decimal’.</p>
<p>When starting with a blank spreadsheet and typing values in the variable
type will change automatically depending on the data you enter. This is
a good way to get a feel for which variable types go with which sorts of
data. Similarly, when opening a data file jamovi will try and guess the
variable type from the data in each column. In both cases this automatic
approach may not be correct, and it may be necessary to manually specify
the variable type with the variable editor.</p>
<p>The variable editor can be opened by selecting ‘Setup’ from the data tab
or by double-clicking on the variable column header. The variable editor
allows you to change the name of the variable and, for data variables,
the variable type, the order of the levels, and the label displayed for
each level. Changes can be applied by clicking the ‘tick’ to the top
right. The variable editor can be dismissed by clicking the ‘Hide’
arrow.</p>
<p>New variables can be inserted or appended to the data set using the
‘add’ button from the data ribbon. The ‘add’ button also allows the
addition of computed variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="computed-variables" class="section level3" number="3.3.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Computed variables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#computed-variables"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Computed Variables are those which take their value by performing a
computation on other variables. Computed Variables can be used for a
range of purposes, including log transforms, z-scores, sum-scores,
negative scoring and means.</p>
<p>Computed variables can be added to the data set with the ‘add’ button
available on the data tab. This will produce a formula box where you can
specify the formula. The usual arithmetic operators are available. Some
examples of formulas are:</p>
<p>A + B LOG10(len) MEAN(A, B) (dose - VMEAN(dose)) / VSTDEV(dose)</p>
<p>In order, these are the sum of A and B, a log (base 10) transform of
len, the mean of A and B, and the z-score of the variable dose. Figure <a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#fig:fig3-3">3.3</a>
shows the jamovi screen for the new variable computed as the
z-score of dose (from the ‘Tooth Growth’ example data set).</p>

<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3.2.1</span> V-functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#v-functions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Several functions are already available in jamovi and available from the
drop down box labelled fx. A number of functions appear in pairs, one
prefixed with a V and the other not. V functions perform their
calculation on a variable as a whole, where as non-V functions perform
their calculation row by row. For example, MEAN(A, B) will produce the
mean of A and B for each row. Where as VMEAN(A) gives the mean of all
the values in A.</p>

</h3>
<p>jamovi produces nice American Psychological Association (APA) formatted
tables and attractive plots. It is often useful to be able to copy and
paste these, perhaps into a Word document, or into an email to a
colleague. To copy results right click on the object of interest and
from the menu select exactly what you want to copy. The menu allows you
to choose to copy only the image or the entire analysis. Selecting
“copy” copies the content to the clipboard and this can be pasted into
other programs in the usual way. You can practice this later on when we
do some analyses.</p>
</div>
<div id="syntax-mode" class="section level3" number="3.3.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3.4</span> Syntax mode<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#syntax-mode"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>jamovi also provides an “R Syntax Mode”. In this mode jamovi produces
equivalent R code for each analysis. To change to syntax mode, select
the Application menu to the top right of jamovi (a button with three
vertical dots) and click the “Syntax mode” checkbox there. You can turn
off syntax mode by clicking this a second time.</p>
<p>In syntax mode analyses continue to operate as before but now they
produce R syntax, and ‘ascii output’ like an R session. Like all results
objects in jamovi, you can right click on these items (including the R
syntax) and copy and paste them, for example into an R session. At
present, the provided R syntax does not include the data import step and
so this must be performed manually in R. There are many resources
explaining how to import data into R and if you are interested we
recommend you take a look at these; just search on the interweb.</p>

</h2>
<p>There are several different types of files that are likely to be
relevant to us when doing data analysis. There are two in particular
that are especially important from the perspective of this book:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>jamovi files</em> are those with a .omv file extension. This is the
standard kind of file that jamovi uses to store data, and variables
and analyses.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Comma separated value (csv) files</em> are those with a .csv file
extension. These are just regular old text files and they can be
opened with many different software programs. It’s quite typical for
people to store data in csv files, precisely because they’re so
simple.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also several other kinds of data file that you might want to
import into jamovi. For instance, you might want to open Microsoft Excel
spreadsheets (.xls files), or data files that have been saved in the
native file formats for other statistics software, such as SPSS or SAS.
Whichever file formats you are using, it’s a good idea to create a
folder or folders especially for your jamovi data sets and analyses and
to make sure you keep these backed up regularly.</p>

</h3>
<p>One quite commonly used data format is the humble “comma separated
value” file, also called a csv file, and usually bearing the file
extension .csv. csv files are just plain old-fashioned text files and
what they store is basically just a table of data. This is illustrated
in Figure <a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#fig:fig3-4">3.4</a>, which shows a file called booksales.csv that I’ve
created. As you can see, each row represents the book sales data for one
month. The first row doesn’t contain actual data though, it has the
names of the variables.</p>
<p>It’s easy to open csv files in jamovi. From the top left menu (the
button with three parallel lines) choose ‘Open’ and browse to where you
have stored the csv file on your computer. If you’re on a Mac, it’ll
look like the usual Finder window that you use to choose a file; on
Windows it looks like an Explorer window. An example of what it looks
like on a Mac is shown in Figure <a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#fig:fig3-5">3.5</a>. I’m assuming that you’re
familiar with your own computer, so you should have no problem finding
the csv file that you want to import! Find the one you want, then click
on the “Open” button.</p>
<p>There are a few things that you can check to make sure that the data
gets imported correctly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heading. Does the first row of the file contain the names for each
variable - a ‘header’ row? The booksales.csv file has a header, so
that’s a yes.</li>
<li>Decimal. What character is used to specify the decimal point? In
English speaking countries this is almost always a period (i.e., .).
That’s not universally true though, many European countries use a
comma.</li>
<li>Quote. What character is used to denote a block of text? That’s
usually going to be a double quote mark (“). It is for the
booksales.csv file.</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p>Throughout this book I’ve assumed that your data are stored as a jamovi
.omv file or as a “properly” formatted csv file. However, in real life
that’s not a terribly plausible assumption to make so I’d better talk
about some of the other possibilities that you might run into.</p>
<div id="loading-data-from-text-files" class="section level3" number="3.5.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.5.1</span> Loading data from text files<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#loading-data-from-text-files"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The first thing I should point out is that if your data are saved as a
text file but aren’t quite in the proper csv format then there’s still a
pretty good chance that jamovi will be able to open it. You just need to
try it and see if it works. Sometimes though you will need to change
some of the formatting. The ones that I’ve often found myself needing to
change are:</p>
<ul>
<li>header. A lot of the time when you’re storing data as a csv file the
first row actually contains the column names and not data. If that’s
not true then it’s a good idea to open up the csv file in a
spreadsheet programme such as Open Office and add the header row
manually.</li>
<li>sep. As the name “comma separated value” indicates, the values in a
row of a csv file are usually separated by commas. This isn’t
universal, however. In Europe the decimal point is typically written
as , instead of . and as a consequence it would be somewhat awkward
to use , as the separator. Therefore it is not unusual to use ;
instead of , as the separator. At other times, I’ve seen a TAB
character used.</li>
<li>quote. It’s conventional in csv files to include a quoting character
for textual data. As you can see by looking at the booksales.csv
file, this is usually a double quote character, “. But sometimes
there is no quoting character at all, or you might see a single
quote mark ’ used instead.</li>
<li>skip. It’s actually very common to receive CSV files in which the
first few rows have nothing to do with the actual data. Instead,
they provide a human readable summary of where the data came from,
or maybe they include some technical info that doesn’t relate to the
data.</li>
<li>missing values. Often you’ll get given data with missing values. For
one reason or another, some entries in the table are missing. The
data file needs to include a “special” value to indicate that the
entry is missing. By default jamovi assumes that this value is
99<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;You can change the default value for missing values in jamovi from
the top right menu (three vertical dots), but this only works at the
time of importing data files into jamovi. The default missing value in
the dataset should not be a valid number associated with any of the
variables, e.g. you could use -9999 as this is unlikely to be a valid
value.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>16</sup></a>, for both numeric and text data, so you should
make sure that, where necessary, all missing values in the csv file
are replaced with 99 (or -9999; whichever you choose) before opening
/ importing the file into jamovi. Once you have opened / imported
the file into jamovi all the missing values are converted to blank
or greyed out cells in the jamovi spreadsheet view. You can also
change the missing value for each variable as an option in the
Data - Setup view.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>The commands listed above are the main ones we’ll need for data files in
this book. But in real life we have many more possibilities. For
example, you might want to read data files in from other statistics
programs. Since SPSS is probably the most widely used statistics package
in psychology, it’s worth mentioning that jamovi can also import SPSS
data files (file extension .sav). Just follow the instructions above for
how to open a csv file, but this time navigate to the .sav file you want
to import. For SPSS files, jamovi will regard all values as missing if
they are regarded as “system missing” files in SPSS. The ‘Default
missings’ value does not seem to work as expected when importing SPSS
files, so be aware of this - you might need another step: import the
SPSS file into jamovi, then export as a csv file before re-opening in
jamovi.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;I know this is a bit of a fudge, but it does work and hopefully
this will be fixed in a later version of jamovi.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>And that’s pretty much it, at least as far as SPSS goes. As far as other
statistical software goes, jamovi can also directly open / import SAS
and STATA files.</p>

</h3>
<p>A different problem is posed by Excel files. Despite years of yelling at
people for sending data to me encoded in a proprietary data format, I
get sent a lot of Excel files. The way to handle Excel files is to open
them up first in Excel or another spreadsheet programme that can handle
Excel files, and then export the data as a csv file before opening /
importing the csv file into jamovi.</p>

</h2>
<p>Sometimes you want to change the variable level. This can happen for all
sorts of reasons. Sometimes when you import data from files, it can come
to you in the wrong format. Numbers sometimes get imported as nominal,
text values. Dates may get imported as text. ParticipantID values can
sometimes be read as continuous: nominal values can sometimes be read as
ordinal or even continuous. There’s a good chance that sometimes you’ll
want to convert a variable from one measurement level into another one.
Or, to use the correct term, you want to <strong>coerce</strong> the variable from
one class into another.</p>
<p>Earlier we saw how to specify different variable levels, and if you want
to change a variable’s measurement level then you can do this in the
jamovi data view for that variable. Just click the check box for the
measurement level you want - continuous, ordinal, or nominal.</p>

</h2>
<p>A really great feature of jamovi is the ability to install add-on
modules from the jamovi library. These add-on modules have been
developed by the jamovi community, i.e., jamovi users and developers who
have created special software add-ons that do other, usually more
advanced, analyses that go beyond the capabilities of the base jamovi
program.</p>
<p>To install add-on modules, just click on the large <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> in the top right
of the jamovi window, select “jamovi-library” and then browse through
the various add-on modules that are available. Choose the one(s) you
want, and then install them, as in Figure <a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#fig:fig3-6">3.6</a>. It’s that easy. The newly
installed modules can then be accessed from the “Analyses” button bar.
Try it…useful add-on modules to install include ”scatr” (added under
“Descriptives”) and <span class="math inline">\(R_j\)</span>.</p>

</h2>
<p>There’s one last thing I should cover in this chapter: how to quit
jamovi. It’s not hard, just close the program the same way you would any
other program. However, what you might want to do before you quit is
save your work! There are two parts to this: saving any changes to the
data set, and saving the analyses that you ran.</p>
<p>It is good practice to save any changes to the data set as a <em>new</em> data
set. That way you can always go back to the original data. To save any
changes in jamovi, select ‘Export’…‘Data’ from the main jamovi menu
(button with three horizontal bars in the top left) and create a new
file name for the changed data set.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can save <em>both</em> the changed data and any analyses you
have undertaken by saving as a jamovi file. To do this, from the main
jamovi menu select ‘Save as’ and type in a file name for this ‘jamovi
file (.omv)’. Remember to save the file in a location where you can find
it again later. I usually create a new folder for specific data sets and
analyses.</p>

<p>Every book that tries to teach a new statistical software program to
novices has to cover roughly the same topics, and in roughly the same
order. Ours is no exception, and so in the grand tradition of doing it
just the same way everyone else did it, this chapter covered the
following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#installing-jamovi">Installing jamovi</a>. We downloaded and installed jamovi, and started it up.</li>
<li>
<a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#analyses">Analyses</a>. We very briefly oriented to the part of jamovi where
analyses are done and results appear, but then deferred this until
later in the book.</li>
<li>
<a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#the-spreadsheet">The spreadsheet</a>. We spent more time looking at the spreadsheet part of
jamovi, and considered different variable types, and how to compute
new variables.</li>
<li>
<a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#loading-data-in-jamovi">Loading data in jamovi</a>. We also saw how to load data files in jamovi.</li>
<li>
<a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#importing-unusual-data-files">Importing unusual data files</a>. Then we figured out how to open other data files, from
different file types.</li>
<li>
<a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#changing-data-from-one-level-to-another">Changing data from one level to another</a>. And saw that sometimes we need to coerce data from one
type to another.</li>
<li>
<a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#installing-add-on-modules-into-jamovi">Installing add-on modules into jamovi</a>. Installing add-on modules from the jamovi community
really extends jamovi capabilities.</li>
<li>
<a href="getting-started-with-jamovi.html#quitting-jamovi">Quitting jamovi</a>. Finally, we looked at good practice in terms of saving
your data set and analyses when you have finished and are about to
quit jamovi.</li>
</ul>
<p>We still haven’t arrived at anything that resembles data analysis. Maybe
the next Chapter will get us a bit closer!</p>
