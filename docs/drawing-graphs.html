<p>Visualising data is one of the most important tasks facing the data
analyst. It’s important for two distinct but closely related reasons.
Firstly, there’s the matter of drawing “presentation graphics”,
displaying your data in a clean, visually appealing fashion makes it
easier for your reader to understand what you’re trying to tell them.
Equally important, perhaps even more important, is the fact that drawing
graphs helps you to understand the data. To that end, it’s important to
draw “exploratory graphics” that help you learn about the data as you go
about analysing it. These points might seem pretty obvious but I cannot
count the number of times I’ve seen people forget them.</p>
<p>To give a sense of the importance of this chapter, I want to start with
a classic illustration of just how powerful a good graph can be. To that
end, Figure <a href="drawing-graphs.html#fig:fig5-1">5.1</a> shows a redrawing of one of the most famous data
visualisations of all time. This is John Snow’s 1854 map of cholera
deaths. The map is elegant in its simplicity. In the background we have
a street map which helps orient the viewer. Over the top we see a large
number of small dots, each one representing the location of a cholera
case. The larger symbols show the location of water pumps, labelled by
name. Even the most casual inspection of the graph makes it very clear
that the source of the outbreak is almost certainly the Broad Street
pump. Upon viewing this graph Dr Snow arranged to have the handle
removed from the pump and ended the outbreak that had killed over 500
people. Such is the power of a good data visualisation.</p>
<p>The goals in this chapter are twofold. First, to discuss several fairly
standard graphs that we use a lot when analysing and presenting data,
and second to show you how to create these graphs in jamovi. The graphs
themselves tend to be pretty straightforward, so in one respect this
chapter is pretty simple. Where people usually struggle is learning how
to produce graphs, and especially learning how to produce good graphs.
Fortunately, learning how to draw graphs in jamovi is reasonably simple
as long as you’re not too picky about what your graph looks like. What I
mean when I say this is that jamovi has a lot of very good default
graphs, or plots, that most of the time produce a clean, high-quality
graphic. However, on those occasions when you do want to do something
non-standard, or if you need to make highly specific changes to the
figure, then the graphics functionality in jamovi is not yet capable of
supporting advanced work or detail editing.</p>

<div id="histograms" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Histograms<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#histograms"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with the humble <strong>histogram</strong>. Histograms are one of the
simplest and most useful ways of visualising data. They make most sense
when you have an interval or ratio scale variable (e.g., the afl.margins
data from the <a href="descriptive-statistics.html#descriptive-statistics">Descriptive statistics</a> chapter and what you want to do is get an overall
impression of the variable. Most of you probably know how histograms
work, since they’re so widely used, but for the sake of completeness
I’ll describe them. All you do is divide up the possible values into
<strong>bins</strong> and then count the number of observations that fall within each
bin. This count is referred to as the frequency or density of the bin
and is displayed as a vertical bar. Ihe AFL winning margins data there
are 33 games in which the winning margin was less than 10 points and it
is this fact that is represented by the height of the leftmost bar that
we showed earlier in the <a href="descriptive-statistics.html#descriptive-statistics">Descriptive statistics</a> chapter, Figure <a href="descriptive-statistics.html#fig:fig4-2">4.2</a>. With these earlier
graphs we used an advanced plotting package in R which, for now, is
beyond the capability of jamovi. But jamovi gets us close, and drawing
this histogram in jamovi is pretty straightforward. Open up the ‘plots’
options under ‘Exploration’ - ‘Descriptives’ and click the ‘histogram’
check box, as in Figure <a href="drawing-graphs.html#fig:fig5-1">5.1</a>. jamovi defaults to labelling the y-axis
as ‘density’ and the x-axis with the variable name. The <strong>bins</strong> are
selected automatically, and there is no scale, or count, information on
the y-axis unlike the previous Figure <a href="descriptive-statistics.html#fig:fig4-2">4.2</a>. But this does not matter
too much because after all what we are really interested in is our
impression of the shape of the distribution: is it normally distributed
or is there a skew or kurtosis? Our first impressions of these
characteristics come from drawing a <strong>histogram</strong>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:fig5-2"></span>
<img src="images/Figure23.PNG" alt="jamovi screen showing the histogram check box" width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 5.2: jamovi screen showing the histogram check box
</p>
</div>
<p>One additional feature that jamovi provides is the ability to plot a
‘Density’ curve. You can do this by clicking the ‘Density’ check box
under the ‘Plots’ options (and unchecking ‘Histogram’), and this gives
us the plot shown in Figure <a href="drawing-graphs.html#fig:fig5-3">5.3</a>. A density plot visualises the
distribution of data over a continuous interval or time period. This
chart is a variation of a histogram that uses <strong>kernel smoothing</strong> to
plot values, allowing for smoother distributions by smoothing out the
noise. The peaks of a density plot help display where values are
concentrated over the interval. An advantage density plots have over
histograms is that they are better at determining the distribution shape
because they’re not affected by the number of bins used (each bar used
in a typical histogram). A histogram comprising of only 4 bins wouldn’t
produce a distinguishable enough shape of distribution as a 20-bin
histogram would. However, with density plots, this isn’t an issue.</p>

</div>
<p>Although this image would need a lot of cleaning up in order to make a
good presentation graphic (i.e., one you’d include in a report), it
nevertheless does a pretty good job of describing the data. In fact, the
big strength of a histogram or density plot is that (properly used) it
does show the entire spread of the data, so you can get a pretty good
sense about what it looks like. The downside to histograms is that they
aren’t very compact. Unlike some of the other plots I’ll talk about it’s
hard to cram 20-30 histograms into a single image without overwhelming
the viewer. And of course, if your data are nominal scale then
histograms are useless.</p>

<div id="boxplots" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Boxplots<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#boxplots"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Another alternative to histograms is a <strong>boxplot</strong>, sometimes called a
“box and whiskers” plot. Like histograms they’re most suited to interval
or ratio scale data. The idea behind a boxplot is to provide a simple
visual depiction of the median, the interquartile range, and the range
of the data. And because they do so in a fairly compact way boxplots
have become a very popular statistical graphic, especially during the
exploratory stage of data analysis when you’re trying to understand the
data yourself. Let’s have a look at how they work, again using the
afl.margins data as our example.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:fig5-4"></span>
<img src="images/Figure25.PNG" alt="A box plot of the afl.margins variable plotted in jamovi" width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 5.4: A box plot of the afl.margins variable plotted in jamovi
</p>
</div>
<p>The easiest way to describe what a boxplot looks like is just to draw
one. Click on the ‘Box plot’ check box and you will get the plot shown
on the lower right of Figure <a href="drawing-graphs.html#fig:fig5-4">5.4</a>. jamovi has drawn the most basic
boxplot possible. When you look at this plot this is how you should
interpret it: the thick line in the middle of the box is the median; the
box itself spans the range from the 25th percentile to the 75th
percentile; and the “whiskers” go out to the most extreme data point
that doesn’t exceed a certain bound. By default, this value is 1.5 times
the interquartile range (IQR), calculated as 25th percentile -
(1.5*IQR) for the lower boundary, and 75th percentile + (1.5*IQR) for
the upper boundary. Any observation whose value falls outside this range
is plotted as a circle or dot instead of being covered by the whiskers,
and is commonly referred to as an <strong>outlier</strong>. For our AFL margins data
there are two observations that fall outside this range, and these
observations are plotted as dots (the upper boundary is 107, and looking
over the data column in the spreadsheet there are two observations with
values higher than this, 108 and 116, so these are the dots).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>A variation to the traditional box plot is the violin plot. Violin plots
are similar to box plots except that they also show the kernel
probability density of the data at different values. Typically, violin
plots will include a marker for the median of the data and a box
indicating the interquartile range, as in standard box plots. In jamovi
you can achieve this sort of functionality by checking both the ‘Violin’
and the ’Box plot’ check boxes. See Figure <a href="drawing-graphs.html#fig:fig5-5">5.5</a>, which also has the
‘Data’ check box turned on to show the actual data points on the plot.
This does tend to make the graph a bit too busy though, in my opinion.
Clarity is simplicity, so in practice it might be better to just use a
simple box plot.</p>

<div id="drawing-multiple-boxplots" class="section level3" number="5.2.2">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Drawing multiple boxplots<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#drawing-multiple-boxplots"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>One last thing. What if you want to draw multiple boxplots at once?
Suppose, for instance, I wanted separate boxplots showing the AFL
margins not just for 2010 but for every year between 1987 and 2010. To
do that the first thing we’ll have to do is find the data. These are
stored in the <strong>aflmarginbyyear.csv</strong> file. So let’s load it into jamovi
and see what is in it. You will see that it is a pretty big data set. It
contains 4296 games and the variables that we’re interested in. What we
want to do is have jamovi draw boxplots for the margin variable, but
plotted separately for each year. The way to do this is to move the year
variable across into the ‘Split by’ box, as in Figure <a href="drawing-graphs.html#fig:fig5-6">5.6</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:fig5-6"></span>
<img src="images/Figure27.PNG" alt="jamovi screen shot showing the ‘Split by’ window" width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 5.6: jamovi screen shot showing the ‘Split by’ window
</p>
</div>
<p>The result is shown in Figure <a href="drawing-graphs.html#fig:fig5-7">5.7</a>. This version of the box plot,
split by year, gives a sense of why it’s sometimes useful to choose box
plots instead of histograms. It’s possible to get a good sense of what
the data look like from year to year without getting overwhelmed with
too much detail. Now imagine what would have happened if I’d tried to
cram 24 histograms into this space: no chance at all that the reader is
going to learn anything useful.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.2.3</span> Using box plots to detect outliers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-box-plots-to-detect-outliers"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Because the boxplot automatically separates out those observations that
lie outside a certain range, depicting them with a dot in jamovi, people
often use them as an informal method for detecting <strong>outliers</strong>:
observations that are “suspiciously” distant from the rest of the data.
Here’s an example. Suppose that I’d drawn the boxplot for the AFL
margins data and it came up looking like Figure <a href="drawing-graphs.html#fig:fig5-8">5.8</a>. It’s pretty clear
that something funny is going on with two of the observations.
Apparently, there were two games in which the margin was over 300
points! That doesn’t sound right to me. Now that I’ve become suspicious
it’s time to look a bit more closely at the data. In jamovi you can
quickly find out which of these observations are suspicious and then you
can go back to the raw data to see if there has been a mistake in data
entry. To do this you need to set up a filter so that only those
observations with values over a certain threshold are included. In our
example, the threshold is over 300, so that is the filter we will
create. First, click on the ‘Filters’ button at the top of the jamovi
window, and then type ‘margin &gt; 300’ into the filter field, as in
Figure <a href="drawing-graphs.html#fig:fig5-9">5.9</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:fig5-8"></span>
<img src="images/Figure29.PNG" alt="A boxplot showing two very suspicious outliers!" width="90%"><p class="caption">
Figure 5.8: A boxplot showing two very suspicious outliers!
</p>
</div>
<p>This filter creates a new column in the spreadsheet view where only
those observations that pass the filter are included. One neat way to
quickly identify which observations these are is to tell jamovi to
produce a ‘Frequency table’ (in the ‘Exploration’ - ‘Descriptives’
window) for the ID variable (which must be a nominal variable otherwise
the Frequency table is not produced). In Figure <a href="drawing-graphs.html#fig:fig5-10">5.10</a> you can see that
the ID values for the observations where the margin was over 300 are 14
and 134. These are suspicious cases, or observations, where you should
go back to the original data source to find out what is going on.</p>

</div>
<p>Usually you find that someone has just typed in the wrong number. Whilst
this might seem like a silly example, I should stress that this kind of
thing actually happens a lot. Real world data sets are often riddled
with stupid errors, especially when someone had to type something into a
computer at some point. In fact, there’s actually a name for this phase
of data analysis and in practice it can take up a huge chunk of our
time: data cleaning. It involves searching for typing mistakes
(“typos”), missing data and all sorts of other obnoxious errors in raw
data files.</p>
<p>For less extreme values, even if they are flagged in a a boxplot as
outliers, the decision about whether to include outliers or exclude them
in any analysis depends heavily on why you think the data look they way
they do and what you want to use the data for. You really need to
exercise good judgement here. If the outlier looks legitimate to you,
then keep it. In any case, I’ll return to the topic again in the section on <a href="correlation-and-linear-regression.html#model-checking">Model checking</a> in the chapter on <a href="correlation-and-linear-regression.html#correlation-and-linear-regression">Correlation and linear regression</a>.</p>

<p>Another form of graph that you often want to plot is the <strong>bar graph</strong>.
Let’s use the afl.finalists data set with the afl.finalists variable
that I introduced in Section 4.1.6. What I want to do is draw a bar
graph that displays the number of finals that each team has played in
over the time spanned by the afl.finalists data set. There are lots of
teams, but I am particularly interested in just four: Brisbane, Carlton,
Fremantle and Richmond. So the first step is to set up a filter so just
those four teams are included in the bar graph. This is straightforward
in jamovi and you can do it by using the ‘Filters’ function that we used
previously. Open up the ‘Filters’ screen and type in the following:</p>
<p>afl.finalists <span class="math inline">\(==\)</span> ‘Brisbane’ or afl.finalists <span class="math inline">\(==\)</span> ‘Carlton’ or
afl.finalists <span class="math inline">\(==\)</span> ‘Fremantle’ or afl.finalists <span class="math inline">\(==\)</span> ‘Richmond’ <a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;jamovi uses the symbol “==” here to mean “matches”.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>When you have done this you will see, in the ‘Data’ view, that jamovi
has filtered out all values apart from those we have specified. Next,
open up the ‘Exploration’ - ‘Descriptives’ window and click on the ‘Bar
plot’ check box (remember to move the ‘afl.finalists’ variable across
into the ‘Variables’ box so that jamovi knows which variable to use).
You should then get a bar graph, something like that shown in Figure
<a href="drawing-graphs.html#fig:fig5-11">5.11</a>.</p>

<p>Hold on, you might be thinking. What’s the good of being able to draw
pretty pictures in jamovi if I can’t save them and send them to friends
to brag about how awesome my data is? How do I save the picture?
Simples. Just right click on the plot image and export it to a file,
either as ‘png’, ‘eps’, ‘svg’ or ‘pdf’. These formats all produce nice
images that you can the send to your friends, or include in your
assignments or papers.</p>

</h2>
<p>Perhaps I’m a simple minded person, but I love pictures. Every time I
write a new scientific paper one of the first things I do is sit down
and think about what the pictures will be. In my head an article is
really just a sequence of pictures linked together by a story. All the
rest of it is just window dressing. What I’m really trying to say here
is that the human visual system is a very powerful data analysis tool.
Give it the right kind of information and it will supply a human reader
with a massive amount of knowledge very quickly. Not for nothing do we
have the saying “a picture is worth a thousand words”. With that in
mind, I think that this is one of the most important chapters in the
book. The topics covered were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Common plots</em>. Much of the chapter was focused on standard graphs
that statisticians like to produce: <a href="drawing-graphs.html#histograms">Histograms</a>,
<a href="drawing-graphs.html#boxplots">Boxplots</a> and <a href="drawing-graphs.html#bar-graphs">Bar graphs</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="drawing-graphs.html#saving-image-files-using-jamovi">Saving image files using jamovi</a>. Importantly, we also covered how to export
your pictures.</li>
</ul>
<p>One final thing to point out. Whilst jamovi produces some really neat
default graphics, editing the plots is currently not possible. For more
advanced graphics and plotting capability the packages available in R
are much more powerful. One of the most popular graphics systems is
provided by the ggplot2 package (see
<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank">https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/</a>), which is loosely based on “The
grammar of graphics” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Wilkinson2006" role="doc-biblioref">Wilkinson et al. 2006</a>)</span>. It’s not for novices. You need to have a pretty good grasp of R before
you can start using it, and even then it takes a while to really get the
hang of it. But when you’re ready it’s worth taking the time to teach
yourself, because it’s a much more powerful and cleaner system.</p>
